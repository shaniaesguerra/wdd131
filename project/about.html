            <h2>Our Vision and Mission</h2>
            <p>Eliah's Bakery has a mission is to be able to create community and give back to the community. We would
                like to create an inclusive community to have a safe space where people of different ethnicities could
                gather and celebrate the Filipino culture just as how it is back home in the Philippines. Our vision is
                to have our baked goods be the instrument for people to create community and learn more about Filipino
                culture.</p>

            <h2>Meet the Owner and the Employee</h2>
            <p>I am Shania Esguerra, the owner and the only employee! I am 24 years old and still trying to earn my
                university degree along side my business. I started this business because I missed the taste of food,
                especially baked goods, back home in the Philippines. There were not a lot of Filipino bakeries in my
                local area that sold them here in Canada. I am not an avid baker at first or even a pro baker. I learned
                with the help of my mom and just the drive of wanting to eat baked goods that is freshly made out of the
                oven. So I learned, I baked, and shared my creations to friends and family. They encouraged me to sell
                it to others. Suprisingly, people loved it! This was the instance when Eliah's Bakery was born as a home
                business. I am still learning as I go and hoping that my brand and company will be well known in the
                future.</p>
